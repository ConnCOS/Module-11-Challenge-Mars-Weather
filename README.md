# Module-11-Challenge-Mars-Weather
In this web-scraping and data analysis challenge, two deliverables are required: One to scrape titles and preview text from news articles about Mars and a second to scrape and analyze a Mars weather data table.
In both cases, scraping is via Beautiful Soup. Two starter files, part_1_mars_news.ipynb and part_2_mars_weather.ipynb are provided.
The following websites were consulted, in addition to class exercises, to complete the work: https://pbpython.com/pandas_dtypes.html and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-dataframe-groupby/. Additionally, during two tutoring sessions, Steve Thomas provided guidance and exceptional patience in assisting with constructing the loop for storing lists.
Finally, the work of another data analyst student, that of Bharat Guturi, was reviewed in plotting some of the charts. His work is found here:
